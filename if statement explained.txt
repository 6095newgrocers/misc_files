$?  -> 0    		(recent command was successfully executed)
$?  -> 1 or other value (recent command was not executed)
			(0 and 1 are called exit status)
		

same with if statement

if mv $source $target (is successful then it will execute the rest)
if [ -f $fname]	    ()


Example:
echo "Enter source and target file names"
read source target
	if mv $source $target
	then
	echo "Your file has been successfully renamed"
fi
